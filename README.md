## Visualization Graphs
Welcome to my data visualization project, where I explore a dataset of movies! The dataset contains various features such as the movie title, average vote, critic vote, country, genre, emotion, humour, erotism, and more. In the first page, you'll find the entire movie dataset with a filter for country and genre to help you find movies that fit your preferences.

Additionally, this project features five different types of visualizations: scatter plot, bar graph, donut plot, radar chart and pie charts. Each of these visualizations provides a unique way to explore the movie dataset, and you can access them from the first page with links.

Whether you're a movie buff or simply interested in exploring data visualization techniques, this project is for you. So, feel free to dive in and discover new insights into the world of movies!

### Scatterplot

The scatter plot for movie ratings versus total votes provides an interesting insight into the movie industry in France. The plot shows how the total number of votes for a movie correlates with its average rating. Each point on the plot represents a single movie, with the X-axis representing the total number of votes for the movie, and the Y-axis representing the average rating.

By analyzing the scatter plot for France, we can gain insights into the movie industry in the country. For instance, we can identify the highest-rated movies with the most votes, indicating the most popular films in France. Additionally, we can see if there is any correlation between the total number of votes a movie receives and its average rating, indicating whether popular movies are usually better rated than less popular ones.

Overall, the scatter plot for movie ratings versus total votes for France provides a comprehensive visual representation of the popularity and quality of movies in the country.

### Donut Chart
The donut chart for movies by country provides a quick and easy way to understand the distribution of movies by country. Each section of the donut chart represents a different country, with the size of the section proportional to the number of movies from that country.

By analyzing the donut chart, we can quickly identify which countries produce the most movies, as well as their relative proportions. This information can be useful for identifying trends in the movie industry and understanding the cultural influences on filmmaking in different regions of the world.

Additionally, the donut chart can be interactive, allowing users to click on each section to explore more details about the movies from that country. This can include information such as the average rating, genre distribution, and other relevant features.

Overall, the donut chart for movies by country provides a simple yet informative way to understand the distribution of movies around the world and the cultural influences that shape the movie industry.

### Bar Graph

The bar graph for movie duration versus year in France provides an insightful way to analyze the change in movie durations over time. The X-axis represents the years, and the Y-axis represents the movie durations in minutes. Each bar in the graph represents the average movie duration for a specific year.

By analyzing the bar graph, we can identify trends in the movie industry in France over time. For instance, we can identify whether the average movie duration has increased or decreased over time. Additionally, we can identify any significant fluctuations in movie duration in response to major cultural or historical events.

The bar graph can also help us identify any outliers or exceptions to these trends, such as movies that deviate significantly from the average duration for a specific year. Overall, the bar graph for movie duration versus year in France provides a useful tool for understanding the changes in movie durations over time and how they relate to broader cultural and historical trends.

### Radar Graph
The radar plot for humor, rhythm, effort, tension, and erotism in Germany provides a visual representation of how different features of movies are distributed in the country. Each axis on the radar plot represents a different feature, with the distance from the center of the plot indicating the magnitude of that feature for a given movie.

By analyzing the radar plot, we can gain insights into how different features of movies are prioritized in Germany. For instance, we can identify if humor is valued more than tension or if erotism is more prevalent than effort in the movies produced in the country.

Additionally, the radar plot can be interactive, allowing users to hover over each point to see more details about the specific movie, including its title, genre, and other relevant features.

Overall, the radar plot for humor, rhythm, effort, tension, and erotism in Germany provides a comprehensive visual representation of the distribution of different movie features in the country, making it a useful tool for understanding the priorities and trends in the German movie industry.

### Pie Chart
The pie chart for genres provides a visual representation of the distribution of movie genres in a particular dataset. Each slice of the pie chart represents a different movie genre, with the size of the slice proportional to the number of movies in that genre.

By analyzing the pie chart, we can quickly identify which genres are the most prevalent in the dataset and their relative proportions. This information can be useful for identifying trends in the movie industry and understanding audience preferences for different types of movies.

Additionally, the pie chart can be interactive, allowing users to click on each slice to explore more details about the movies in that genre. This can include information such as the average rating, country distribution, and other relevant features.

Overall, the pie chart for genres provides a simple yet informative way to understand the distribution of movies by genre and the cultural influences that shape the movie industry.
